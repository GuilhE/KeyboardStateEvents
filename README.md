## Usage

Call `bindKeyboardStateEvents()` in you `AppCompatActivity` or `FragmentActivity` and observe `KeyboardLiveData.state` to get notified:
```java
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        ...
        KeyboardLiveData.state.observe(this, Observer {...})
        bindKeyboardStateEvents()
    }
}
```
Just that and you're done! ðŸ˜Ž

Also, some handy extension functions:  
```java
ComponentActivity.toggleKeyboard()
ComponentActivity.dismissKeyboard()
ComponentActivity.isKeyboardOpen()
ViewGroup.isKeyboardOpen()
```
