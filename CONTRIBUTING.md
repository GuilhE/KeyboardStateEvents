# Contributing

In an effort to keep the library small and stable, please keep contributions limited to bug fixes, documentation improvements, and test improvements.

If you have a new feature idea, please [create an enhancement request](https://github.com/GuilhE/KeyboardStateEvents/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) so it can be discussed or build it in an external library.

If youâ€™ve found a bug, please [create a bug report](https://github.com/GuilhE/KeyboardStateEvents/issues/new?assignees=GuilhE&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) and contribute with a failing test case so we can study and fix it.

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
